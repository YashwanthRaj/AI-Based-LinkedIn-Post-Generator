We’re also funding $1 billion to support AI education and job training programs, including making our Grow with Google AI and career training free for every college student in America. \n\nHaving regular access to computers in grad school changed my life, and led me on the path to Google. It’s my hope that bringing the best AI tools to today’s college students will open up new worlds for them, too. Deadline for students to apply for the AI Pro Plan offer is October 6th!

That’s why we’re making a long-term bet to help prove and scale it, in the same way we’re doing for nuclear energy from small modular reactors and geothermal. \n\nTo start, we’re making the largest direct corporate purchase of fusion power from Commonwealth Fusion Systems’s future plant. We’re also investing to help them build on promising breakthroughs. For example, their high-temperature superconductor magnets can be used by smaller machines, which are significantly cheaper and faster to build.\n\nThe path to commercialization won’t be easy, but we think the upsides could be transformative.",

We’re also rolling out new tools for building and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems.\n🔹 YouTube celebrated its 20th birthday — still #1 in U.S. streaming on TVs, and now with 125M+ Music & Premium subscribers and over a billion podcast users.\n🔹Waymo is now serving 250,000+ paid rides a week, and started operation in Silicon Valley. Miami and DC coming next year!\n\nThis work is only possible thanks to the incredible teams across Alphabet — thank you.

It’s coming later this year!)\n\nWe also announced that Cloud Wide Area Network, based on Google’s own global-scale network, is coming soon too. And we launched new features in Google Agentspace that make it easier to create and adopt agents, as well as Gemini 2.5 Flash, our low-latency and most cost-efficient model with “thinking” built-in - coming soon in AI Studio, Vertex + Gemini app. \n\nAI enables powerful new capabilities, but the most exciting part is what people do with them. \n\nI saw an incredible example of that last night at Las Vegas Sphere, where we gave a sneak peek into how AI is helping to enrich the Wizard of Oz experience coming to the Sphere later this year. Google’s been working with visual effects artists around the world and our AI models to effectively bring the film’s original characters to a whole new life for 2025.

After a successful flight over the weekend, the first FireSat satellite is now in orbit! 🛰️ It’s the first of about 50 that we’re launching over the coming few years to help track and detect wildfires, using AI. \n\nFireSat was designed to give us better tools to track and detect fires. Using advanced sensors and high resolution, it can detect a fire as small as 5x5 meters, which wasn't possible before. It updates every 20 minutes, comparing fresh imagery against historical data and factoring in local conditions like infrastructure and weather. Then it beams updates to emergency teams on the ground so they can react in real time. \n\nFireSat builds on our work using AI to map the boundaries of large wildfires and get people accurate information in 27 countries (including during the LA fires earlier this year.) In the next few weeks we’ll start testing, and the system will be fully operational over the next few years.\n\nThis is a huge effort with many partners including Muon Space, Earth Fire Alliance, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Here’s a photo of the satellite on the launch pad last Friday, waiting for a ride:",

It’s been amazing to see so many leaders across tech, business and government gathered in one place to talk about the opportunity with AI. \n\nAs I said in my remarks at the Grand Palais, that opportunity is as big as it gets. There are so many examples of how AI is already transforming science, business, and how we live, learn and work. It’s why we at Google are so energized about this moment, and the most exciting use cases are still to come. (You can read my full remarks here: https://goo.gle/3CMn2qw). \n\nAfter the summit, I had the chance to visit the Institut Curie, which is using Google’s AI tools to better predict the progression of women’s cancers and develop more effective treatments. A year ago I visited the Institut for the first time to start these conversations. So much progress has been made in just a year! I got to look at some of the tissue samples that can now be processed at a massive scale, thanks to AI. It’s an incredible reminder of the potential of this technology to save lives.",

We’re in a great rhythm – building, testing and launching products faster than ever before. Our leadership in AI innovation and our unique full-stack approach is translating into product usage, revenue growth and results.\n\nWe saw dramatic progress in AI, including with our latest model Gemini 2.0. Over 4.4 million developers are now building with Gemini, our Gemini app is now on iOS and doing really well there, and we’re seeing great feedback on our latest thinking models. Our Deep Research agentic research assistant, launched in December, is now on all Android devices, really recommend giving it a try if you haven’t yet.\n\nIn Search, AI Overviews are now available in more than 100 countries, and continue to drive higher satisfaction and increased Search usage. Circle to Search is going great, too. 2025 is going to be a big year for search innovation.\n\nOur Cloud and YouTube businesses finished the year strong, reaching a combined annual run rate of $110 billion.

This is a special milestone for so many reasons, but most of all because it represents 1 million stories of people looking to pursue new opportunities and careers. People like James Bingham, a former staff sergeant in the US AirForce who landed a civilian job as an IT Project Manager with help from our Project Management certificate.That list also includes Natalie Burns, who I met in 2019. Natalie earned her Google IT Support certificate while attending community college in Texas. She got a job in cybersecurity and a significant pay increase. In total, more than 70% of graduates report a positive career outcome within 6 months of completing our certificates, be it a job change, a promotion, or a raise. \n\nIt also represents a greater impact than we could have imagined when we launched our first certificate in IT on Coursera in 2018. At the time, we were noticing a gap between the number of unfilled positions in tech and the number of people who were hungry to fill those roles, yet didn’t have access to the necessary training. Our Career Certificates could help fill that gap, providing pathways to learning that didn’t require a previous degree.\n\nMore than six years later, we now offer several certificates in fields like data analytics, cybersecurity, UX design and more. It’s a model we think can be replicated and expanded to even more opportunities, which will be especially important as we transition the economy for the AI era.",

This is on top of the more than $200 million Google.org has provided for this work over the last five years. \n\nAI has massive potential to benefit the world, so we are acting boldly to apply it as quickly as we can, while doing so responsibly.

I always find Japan to be a place willing to adopt new technologies, and I could clearly see the big shift in the progress happening with AI, from the cutting edge research to the vibrant startup AI ecosystem to an incredible developer community.\n\nThe main reason for my visit was for a gathering of Google's top customers in Japan, including government and business leaders. While there, I watched rakugo, a traditional form of Japanese comedy, for the first time. Bunshi Katsura, a legendary rakugo artist, showed me how he used Gemini to enhance his set. It was incredibly moving to see such an honored tradition transformed by AI, while keeping humanity at the heart.\n\nI also spent time with students and developers. I met with researchers from the Matsuo Lab at the University of Tokyo to hear more about how they are tackling hard challenges in AI, and middle school students taking part in Mind the Gap, our grassroots program designed to address the underrepresentation of women in technology. And I dropped by to say thank you to our Japanese and South Korean developer community and help unveil our Japanese-tuned Gemma 2 2B.\n\nOf course, my favorite part of traveling is seeing Googlers around the world. I joined Googlers at our Tokyo office and around the region to talk about the deep investments happening there and the incredible opportunities ahead. We also welcomed a very special celebrity guest to the Tokyo office — Pikachu — to celebrate an amazing milestone for Pokémon Kids TV Japan (in addition to the millions of subscribers on their global channel).
