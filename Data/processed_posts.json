Using advanced sensors and high resolution, it can detect a fire as small as 5x5 meters, which wasn't possible before. It updates every 20 minutes, comparing fresh imagery against historical data and factoring in local conditions like infrastructure and weather. Then it beams updates to emergency teams on the ground so they can react in real time. \n\nFireSat builds on our work using AI to map the boundaries of large wildfires and get people accurate information in 27 countries (including during the LA fires earlier this year.) In the next few weeks we\u2019ll start testing, and the system will be fully operational over the next few years.\n\nThis is a huge effort with many partners including Muon Space, Earth Fire Alliance, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

Our leadership in AI innovation and our unique full-stack approach is translating into product usage, revenue growth and results.\n\nWe saw dramatic progress in AI, including with our latest model Gemini 2.0. Over 4.4 million developers are now building with Gemini, our Gemini app is now on iOS and doing really well there, and we\u2019re seeing great feedback on our latest thinking models.

Circle to Search is going great, too. 2025 is going to be a big year for search innovation.\n\nOur Cloud and YouTube businesses finished the year strong, reaching a combined annual run rate of $110 billion.

People like James Bingham, a former staff sergeant in the US AirForce who landed a civilian job as an IT Project Manager with help from our Project Management certificate.That list also includes Natalie Burns, who I met in 2019. Natalie earned her Google IT Support certificate while attending community college in Texas. She got a job in cybersecurity and a significant pay increase. In total, more than 70% of graduates report a positive career outcome within 6 months of completing our certificates, be it a job change, a promotion, or a raise. \n\nIt also represents a greater impact than we could have imagined when we launched our first certificate in IT on Coursera in 2018. At the time, we were noticing a gap between the number of unfilled positions in tech and the number of people who were hungry to fill those roles, yet didn\u2019t have access to the necessary training. Our Career Certificates could help fill that gap, providing pathways to learning that didn\u2019t require a previous degree.\n\nMore than six years later, we now offer several certificates in fields like data analytics, cybersecurity, UX design and more. It\u2019s a model we think can be replicated and expanded to even more opportunities, which will be especially important as we transition the economy for the AI era.",

I always find Japan to be a place willing to adopt new technologies, and I could clearly see the big shift in the progress happening with AI, from the cutting edge research to the vibrant startup AI ecosystem to an incredible developer community.\n\nThe main reason for my visit was for a gathering of Google's top customers in Japan, including government and business leaders. While there, I watched rakugo, a traditional form of Japanese comedy, for the first time. Bunshi Katsura, a legendary rakugo artist, showed me how he used Gemini to enhance his set. It was incredibly moving to see such an honored tradition transformed by AI, while keeping humanity at the heart.\n\nI also spent time with students and developers. I met with researchers from the Matsuo Lab at the University of Tokyo to hear more about how they are tackling hard challenges in AI, and middle school students taking part in Mind the Gap, our grassroots program designed to address the underrepresentation of women in technology. And I dropped by to say thank you to our Japanese and South Korean developer community and help unveil our Japanese-tuned Gemma 2 2B.\n\nOf course, my favorite part of traveling is seeing Googlers around the world. I joined Googlers at our Tokyo office and around the region to talk about the deep investments happening there and the incredible opportunities ahead.
