## üß† Project Architecture

The project consists of two main stages: **Pre-processing** and **Post Generation**.

### **Stage 1: Pre-Processing**

This stage involves analyzing historical post data to extract structure and meaning.

#### 1.1 Data Collection
- For demonstration, posts from Sundar Pichai‚Äôs LinkedIn were manually collected.
- Stored in JSON format with two fields:
  - `text`: Post content
  - `engagement`: Likes and comments

#### 1.2 Environment Setup
- Python environment using **PyCharm**
- Project directory structure:
  - `data/` for raw and processed JSON files
  - `.env` for Groq API key (excluded via `.gitignore`)
  
#### 1.3 LLM Helper Module
- A helper script to interface with **Llama 3.1 8B** via Groq API
- Uses environment variables from `.env` file
- Handles authentication and prompt completion

#### 1.4 Data Enrichment
- Adds `text_count` and `tags` fields for each post using LLM
- Tags capture topic-level semantics of each post
